</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="ONE" tags="" position="104,127">The doorknob is cool under your hand, brass and crystal catching the light from the streetlamps.

You&#x27;re late getting home.

[[Look around]]
[[Go inside]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Look around" tags="" position="442,12">It&#x27;s a warm summer&#x27;s night.

It rained just before you got here. You can smell it. There&#x27;s a sheen of the street lamps in the wet black pavement.

The humidity is making your hair lose its shape more than it already has.

There&#x27;s a light coming from the parlor window.

[[It&#x27;s after midnight-&gt;ONE]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Go inside" tags="" position="289,160">With the light on, you can see the shapes of movement inside. At least one person. Maybe more.

You could [[try to sneak past them]], or [[go in and face the music]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="try to sneak past them" tags="" position="51,249">You open the door as quietly as you possibly can.

The hinges are well-oiled. The floorboards are firm, new. Nothing creaks.

[[Walk on your toes]] so your heels don&#x27;t click.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="go in and face the music" tags="" position="694,15">The parlor is empty aside from a tall man with a round face and a bushy, dark mustache. [[His face is very different than your own]].

Your father is sitting in his chair with a newspaper, which he folds as he stands when you reach the doorway.

&quot;Margaret,&quot; he says. &quot;You&#x27;d better have a seat.&quot;

[[You enter]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Walk on your toes" tags="" position="39,377">You slip easily over the wood to the thick hallway runner carpet.

[[Remember?]]

[[Head up the grand stair]]
[[Slip through the kitchen to the back stairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Remember?" tags="" position="161,328">You&#x27;re no more than four, laying on your tummy on this carpet, playing with a little tin truck.

The wheels make divots in the plush of the rug. The rug smells old, like dust.


&quot;Margaret, love, put that down, that&#x27;s your brother&#x27;s.&quot;


[[It&#x27;s funny, the little things you think of-&gt;Walk on your toes]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Head up the grand stair" tags="" position="16,501">It&#x27;s closer to your room, anyhow, and this way you don&#x27;t have to pass in front of the parlor doors.

[[Skip the first step]]
[[Skip the third step]]
[[Back out and try something else-&gt;Slip through the kitchen to the back stairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Slip through the kitchen to the back stairs" tags="" position="195,475">From the front door, there&#x27;s a staircase leading to the upstairs hall. There&#x27;s also a hallway going directly back. The doors to the living room, library, and parlor branch off from the lefthand side of the hall.

Directly back is the dining room, and through that the servant&#x27;s door to the kitchen. In the kitchen is a narrow, claustorophic back stair. It&#x27;d be a long way to go, but possibly more quiet than right up the creaky stair.

If you&#x27;re quick, you might be able to make it.

[[Back out and try something else-&gt;Head up the grand stair]]

[[Make a dash for it!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Skip the first step" tags="" position="16,633">You skip the first step, landing on the second. It creaks more than you remember, and you wince at the sound.

A noise from the parlor. A newspaper folding.

&quot;Maryanne? Maryanne is that you?&quot;

[[Lie]]
[[Stay silent]]
[[Come clean]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Skip the third step" tags="" position="170,613">You skip the third stair, but your dess&#x27;s hemline is so long and the skirt is so narrow that you catch yourself and trip.

[[CRASH]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Lie" tags="" position="0,797">You try to change the pitch of your voice.

&quot;Yes?&quot; you say, clipped, demure, higher pitched than your actual voice.

&quot;Maryanne, would you fetch me a coffee?&quot;

You can [[ignore him]] or you could [[reveal yourself]].

Your father is not going to buy that you&#x27;re the maid if you actually try to bring him a coffee.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Stay silent" tags="" position="135,801">You say nothing, frozen on the stair.

&quot;Maryanne, fetch me another cup of coffee, would you?&quot;

You could [[ignore him]].

Or [[reveal yourself]].

You&#x27;re not gonna&#x27; trick your father into thinking you&#x27;re the maid if you actually try to bring him a coffee, that much is obvious.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Come clean" tags="" position="287,824">&quot;No, daddy,&quot; you say, &quot;Not Maryanne.&quot;

There&#x27;s a sound you can&#x27;t quite make out from the parlor.

&quot;Margaret, come here.&quot;

[[Go in and face the music-&gt;go in and face the music]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="ignore him" tags="" position="17,995">You could shut your mouth, dash up to your room, and be done with it.

But that would get Maryanne in trouble sooner or later. You might get out of trouble, but she might get fired.

Are you sure?
[[Yes, I&#x27;m getting out of this!]]
No, I&#x27;ll [[come clean-&gt;Come clean]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="reveal yourself" tags="" position="156,997">You cringe but you don&#x27;t put on a fake voice when you speak.

&quot;No, daddy, it&#x27;s Margaret.&quot;

&quot;Margaret.&quot; He sounds like he already knew. &quot;Come in here.&quot;

[[Go in and face the music-&gt;go in and face the music]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Yes, I&#x27;m getting out of this!" tags="" position="18,1115">You don&#x27;t say anything, darting up the stairs, slipping into your room, and shutting the door.

You rush out of your stained party dress, kick off your heels, tie on a hair scarf, and wipe off all your lipstick.

You slip into bed, mind racing with how you&#x27;ll cover your ass tomorrow.

But that&#x27;s a tomorrow problem. You&#x27;ve gotten yourself out of the trouble.

[[This time]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="CRASH" tags="" position="297,655">The slick sole of your leather pumps slides down the very well-oiled wood.

The glove on your hand is no help on the bannister.

You end up on your ass at the foot of the stairs.

[[You hear footsteps]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="You hear footsteps" tags="" position="411,666">The next thing you know, your father is standing over you.

He&#x27;s tall and thin, with a very round face, a bushy but well-groomed brunette mustache that&#x27;s just beginning to get a bit of salt in it.

He still has his full suit and jacket on, along with his vest and tie, even at this hour.

[[You don&#x27;t actually look much like him.]]

[[&quot;Margaret.&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="You don&#x27;t actually look much like him." tags="" position="539,669">You take after your mother.

The Carnegie face is rounder, the nose flatter, the hair darker.

You did get your father&#x27;s height, though, perhaps the most unfortunate thing for a young lady to have recieved.

Boys don&#x27;t like dancing with you because you&#x27;re too tall.

[[But that&#x27;s neither here nor there-&gt;You hear footsteps]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="&quot;Margaret.&quot;" tags="" position="412,790">&quot;Hello, daddy!&quot; You smile, all chipper. As if it&#x27;s not one in the morning. As if you weren&#x27;t just caught sneaking in.

&quot;It&#x27;s late,&quot; he says. &quot;Are you just getting home?&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir. It was such a lovely night I-&quot;

He cuts you off with a wave of his hand and reaches for you.

[[Accept the hand up.]]
[[Get up on your own.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Accept the hand up." tags="" position="308,938">He doesn&#x27;t look happy, but at least he doesn&#x27;t look more angry.

&quot;Parlor,&quot; he said curtly. He leads the way. You brush yourself off and walk down the hallwally, feeling a little more sore for your fall.

He stands back, gesturing to the empty room.

[[You enter]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Get up on your own." tags="" position="442,925">You ignore his hand and push yourself up to your feet.

He frowns deeply.

&quot;Margaret, I don&#x27;t like this unladylike behavior I&#x27;m seeing from you.&quot;

[[Apologize]]
[[Brush him off]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="You enter" tags="" position="880,15">The parlor is for recieving guests.

It is full of books, but distinct from the library in the nature of the books. These ones are primarily focused on aesthetics on the shelves, as opposed to actual reading content. If a guest was going to be impressed by books, they&#x27;d be shown to the library anyway.

It has places to sit, but it&#x27;s more formal than the family&#x27;s living room. The living room is more of a private space, with the second best furniture, the family&#x27;s slightly more worn horsehair sofa from Grandfather&#x27;s house, rather than this one, upholstered in pink silk and [[blue velvet]].

The fact that your father was waiting in the parlor is probably a good indicator of how much trouble you&#x27;re in.

[[Sit down]]

[[Remain standing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="Apologize" tags="" position="319,1058">&quot;Sorry, daddy,&quot; you say, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t want to knock you over!&quot;

&quot;Your diet is your mother&#x27;s business, Margaret, a man&#x27;s strength is his own.&quot;

You notice how neither of these things are your business, even though it was your decision in standing up.

&quot;Parlor, now.&quot; He gestures to the room and leads the way.

[[You enter]] the empty parlor. Your tailbone aches.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Brush him off" tags="" position="468,1065">&quot;Oh daddy,&quot; you tsk, brushing off the knees of your dress. &quot;I&#x27;m a liberated lady! We got the ballot box, why not stand on our own?&quot;

He does not look especailly happy about this, but you keep talking before he can get in a word.

&quot;You cannot push any one up a ladder unless he be willing to climb a little himself,&quot; you affect a sage, deep tone.

&quot;Don&#x27;t try to quote your uncle to get out of this, Margaret,&quot; he says sternly, pointing to the parlor.

[[You enter]] the room, feeling sore, but at least a bit pleased with yourself. Nothing gets you out of trouble faster than invoking Dear Uncle Andrew.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="Make a dash for it!" tags="" position="281,352">You gather your skirts in your hand, thanking Jesus that they&#x27;re calf-length and not dragging on the floor as you rush down the hall.

You pass the open doorway to the parlor, get a few steps further, think you&#x27;ve made it when you hear a voice-

&quot;Margaret? Was that you?&quot;

[[Busted.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Busted." tags="" position="406,205">&quot;...Yes, daddy,&quot; you say, stopping in the hall and hanging your head.

&quot;Margaret. Come in here.&quot; He doesn&#x27;t sound particularly happy.

Might as well [[go in and face the music]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="His face is very different than your own" tags="" position="562,9">You take after your mother.

The Carnegie face is rounder, the nose flatter, the hair darker.

You did get your father&#x27;s height, though, perhaps the most unfortunate thing for a young lady to have recieved.

Boys don&#x27;t like dancing with you because you&#x27;re too tall.

[[But that&#x27;s neither here nor there-&gt;go in and face the music]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="blue velvet" tags="" position="1014,20">You had a dress made of blue velvet once, when you were younger. You bought it while on school holiday with a friend. But your mother said you looked like you were seeking employment at a bordello, and that was the end of that dress.

You wonder what happened to it. It was so fashionable.

[[Anyway-&gt;You enter]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="Sit down" tags="" position="879,135">The silk of the armchair is awkwardly slippery under the linen of your dress.

Your father remains standing.

&quot;Margaret,&quot; he says, &quot;Would you care to explain yourself?&quot;

[[Play dumb]]
[[Explain yourself]]
[[Say nothing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Remain standing" tags="" position="1056,155">&quot;Margaret,&quot; your father says sternly, &quot;//Sit. Down.//&quot;

[[You do it without even thinking.-&gt;Sit down]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Play dumb" tags="" position="729,213">You&#x27;re pretty sure you can fib your way out of this.

That generally works, after all.

&quot;Explain what, daddy?&quot; you ask.

You [[sit like a lady]] and [[smile at him]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Explain yourself" tags="" position="1396,93">Honesty is the best policy, right?

&quot;I went out to a place called the Farm,&quot; you say with a sigh. &quot;It was a meeting spot for a few of the gangs in the area. The Jin, the Root, the Mischpacha, the.. uh.. Cuervos. They all got together to discuss turf. It was very glamorous and dangerous. The leader of the Root invited me for the weekend. I&#x27;m so late getting because I stayed later than I originally planned, to make sure everyone else was ok, since it got a little violent. Anyway, I&#x27;m sorry. I learned my lesson.&quot;

He&#x27;s frowning at you.

You look at his face.

[[He doesn&#x27;t believe you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Say nothing" tags="" position="1202,13">You button your lip, for once in your life.

Your father exhales slowly. &quot;Then I am to assume to worst?&quot;

[[Silence]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="sit like a lady" tags="" position="537,239">Legs tilted to one side and crossed at the ankle (//not// at the knee like a loose woman)

Hands (gloved) folded over your knee.

Your shoulders are bare in this dress, which won&#x27;t win you any points, but at least it&#x27;s not the beaded flapper number you wore last night when you //should// have been getting home.

You&#x27;re the very picture of a modern young lady.

[[Your family generally meets this with approval-&gt;Play dumb]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="smile at him" tags="" position="655,362">He isn&#x27;t buying it.

&quot;Explain to me,&quot; he says slowly, loudly, like you&#x27;re deaf or dumb, &quot;Why my only daughter is getting home alone at this hour?&quot;

[[Deflect]]
[[Stretch the truth]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Deflect" tags="" position="530,485">&quot;Oh, daddy, I&#x27;m so exhausted,&quot; you say, feigning a big yawn. &quot;I promise you, I can explain it all over breakfast, but it&#x27;s so very late-- and you know, I didn&#x27;t want to be home this late either-- and I&#x27;m just plum tuckered out, so really, I ought to be off getting my beauty rest, and then I&#x27;ll fill you in on everything over coffee.&quot;

&quot;Young lady, you will explain this to me now or you can sit here for the rest of the night.&quot;

[[Explain yourself]]
[[Stretch the truth]]
[[Get upset]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Stretch the truth" tags="" position="865,316">&quot;I was... at a lovely farm upstate. To attend a social gathering. It was all very quiet, well behaved, and I had an older lady friend escorting me the whole time.&quot;

Your father nods, &quot;This older lady escort wouldn&#x27;t happen to go by the name [[Rossi]], would she?&quot;

[[&quot;No, sir, Mrs. Peabody.&quot;]]
[[&quot;No, sir, Miss Valesquez&quot;]]
[[&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Get upset" tags="" position="651,583">You stand up. &quot;Father, I am a grown woman! I am twenty years old and I don&#x27;t have to explain anything to you!&quot;

&quot;Grown?&quot; the color is rising in your father&#x27;s face. He has a tendency to go red when he&#x27;s angry. &quot;Grown! Young lady you are unmarried, and until the moment you are in your husband&#x27;s care you are //far// from grown! I will not be spoken to like this by any daughter of mine!&quot;

[[&quot;Well I just did!&quot;]]
[[Shut up before you make it worse]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="&quot;Well I just did!&quot;" tags="" position="646,729">&quot;I&#x27;ll speak how I please, father!&quot; you declare. You stomp your foot on the ground for good measure.

It occurs to you that this is almost certinaly waking up your mother, all the servants, and possibly your older brother, if he&#x27;s home.

Your mother is the one that makes you cringe.

[[Mention your brother]].
[[Mention your mother]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Shut up before you make it worse" tags="" position="739,463">You&#x27;ve already shoved your foot in your mouth. So now you button it and sit there, chastised, looking at the floor.

Deflecting and lying would only make it worse, after all.

Better to just [[take the lecture-&gt;Say nothing]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Mention your brother" tags="" position="617,879">&quot;And where&#x27;s Thomas junior?&quot; you ask, tone haughty. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he&#x27;s out later than I am, carousing with young ladies, no doubt!&quot;

&quot;Your brother is older than you, and he&#x27;s a young man. It&#x27;s not //seemly// for you to be out at all hours! Do you know what people say about girls like you? Running around with- with your little girlfriends all night long?&quot;

This is about to go somewhere very bad.

[[Change the topic as fast as you can]]
[[Dig in your heels]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Mention your mother" tags="" position="782,847">You try to yank this conversation back under control.

&quot;Father, please, let&#x27;s keep our voices down,&quot; you say, losing your volume rapidly as you speak. &quot;We&#x27;ll wake mother.&quot;

&quot;If you were so concerned about your mother, you&#x27;d have been home before dinner.&quot;

[[Focus on mother]]
[[Focus on the hour]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="Change the topic as fast as you can" tags="" position="598,1041">Whatever you do, you //cannot// let him start asking //those// sorts of questions.

&quot;Your friends?&quot; Your father looks more livid than you&#x27;d seen him in years. &quot;A proper young lady knows what is and isn&#x27;t appropriate to do with her //friends// in public.&quot;

[[&quot;What do you mean?&quot;]]
[[&quot;At least I&#x27;m not falling all over boys!&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="Focus on mother" tags="" position="941,941">You nod. &quot;You&#x27;re right, daddy,&quot; you say. &quot;I&#x27;m sure mother was in an absolute tizzy. I hope I didn&#x27;t make you all wait long?&quot;

Your father seems suspicious, like he&#x27;s doubting where you&#x27;re going with this, but he answers. &quot;We waited nearly an hour for you.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;m so sorry, daddy. If there had been a phone I would have called so you wouldn&#x27;t worry.&quot;

He gives you a look. &quot;Where were you, exactly?&quot;

[[Be honest]]
[[Be not-so-honest]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="Focus on the hour" tags="" position="940,807">&quot;It&#x27;s such a late hour,&quot; you say with more of a firm tone, exhaling in a bored, exhausted sort of way. &quot;Really, daddy, I&#x27;m just too tired to carry on conversation any longer. And me without having had any dinner at all... Surely this can wait?&quot;

You smile disarmingly. You know just the way to do it. &quot;Mother&#x27;s in bed already. You should go join her, I&#x27;ll go off to bed, and tomorrow I&#x27;ll spend all day here, keeping her company.&quot;

He looks at you. &quot;And what will you do when she asks you where you&#x27;ve been? When she tells you the things people have been saying?&quot;

&quot;Why,&quot; you say, &quot;[[Make up an excuse]], I suppose.&quot;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="&quot;What do you mean?&quot;" tags="" position="683,1176">&quot;What do I mean?&quot; your father scoffs as he echos you.

His tone has just a hint more of the Old Country in it than your All-American, boarding school diction lessons voice. You can tell his father was F.O.B. Scottish, something your mother has been eager to discourage in you and your brother.

&quot;I mean that I hear things, Margaret. About you running around with known... daggers.&quot;

Your gasp is fully involuntarily. You&#x27;ve never heard your father swear like that. It&#x27;s shocking.

[[Make up an excuse]]
[[Faint]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="&quot;At least I&#x27;m not falling all over boys!&quot;" tags="" position="833,1176">Your father throws his hands in the air.

&quot;Ah, so you&#x27;ve given me the choice of the century! Tell me, should a father prefer a whore or a dagger for a daughter?&quot;

Your eyes go wide. You&#x27;ve never heard your father swear like this.

[[Get angry]]
[[Get meek]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="Make up an excuse" tags="" position="552,1303">Your only hope now is to diffuse this situation.

&quot;Father,&quot; you say softly, &quot;Father. You know people talk. People gossip and say all manner of... nasty, rude things. Things that just aren&#x27;t true. I&#x27;m just trying to have a little fun... be young... and stay away from all the boys who might get me in trouble. Isn&#x27;t that what you //want// me to do, daddy?&quot;

[[You hold your breath]]...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="52" name="Faint" tags="" position="396,1300">You take the opportunity of the shock to your absolute best advantage.

You heavily swoon, slumping back, letting the chair catch your fall and slow it as you slip to the floor.

Are you faking it? Is it for real?

It doesn&#x27;t really matter so long as you&#x27;re believed.

This isn&#x27;t done, but as your father sighs heavily, scoops you up, and deposits you in your own room, you fight off a smile. You&#x27;ve at least bought yourself a few hours to talk your way out.

[[This time]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="53" name="This time" tags="" position="100,1300">Thank you for playing.

Give it another go, and see if you end up somewhere different.

[[Play again?-&gt;ONE]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="You hold your breath" tags="" position="485,1425">...but it seems to have worked.

Your father takes a few deep breaths. His shoulders relax.

&quot;Alright, Margaret, alright,&quot; he says. &quot;But you need to be more careful. I can&#x27;t have you getting caught up in any more compromising situations like the ones you have in the past.&quot;

[[&quot;What situations?&quot;]]
[[Promise to be more careful]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="&quot;What situations?&quot;" tags="" position="608,1501">He frowns.

&quot;Margaret, how little of your business do you really think gets back to your mother and I?&quot; He shakes his head slowly. &quot;We know about the speakeasies and the parties. The bars and the little vacations. You need to use more caution, dearheart.&quot; He snorts. &quot;It&#x27;s expensive, keeping up with you and ahead of the press.&quot;

[[&quot;You&#x27;ve been having me followed?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="56" name="Promise to be more careful" tags="" position="381,1584">&quot;I promise I&#x27;ll take care,&quot; you say slowly.

Your father nods his approval. &quot;Now off to bed with you. If your mother asks in the morning, tell her you were back around ten.&quot;

Ten. Bad, but not as bad at after midnight.

You nod and kiss your father on the cheek before scurrying [[off to bed]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="&quot;You&#x27;ve been having me followed?&quot;" tags="" position="547,1622">He shakes his head. &quot;I don&#x27;t need to. You give your name, people listen, Margaret.&quot;

You suddenly feel very, very foolish.

&quot;Please, just promise your father you&#x27;ll be more careful? And behave yourself a little more.&quot;

[[Promise to be more careful]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="off to bed" tags="" position="240,1602">You lie there in the dark, staring at the ceiling.

Chastised like a girl half your age. All because there&#x27;s no ring on your finger. All because you were a couple hours late coming home.

You think about being somewhere else. Wrapped up in another bed, with soft arms around you.

Somewhere where you can be someone else.

Your off the hook for now, but you can&#x27;t stop thinking about your father covering for you.

[[You don&#x27;t wait around]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="60" name="Get meek" tags="" position="862,1295">You shut your mouth right away. You stare at the floor.

Petulant.

Like a child.

You slam the door shut behind you and sink to the floor on the other side.

A whore or a dagger.

You wonder which one he&#x27;d say he&#x27;d prefer, if pressed. (Probably a whore, but you never know.)

You know you&#x27;ll never, ever be able to explain to him that, by his estimation, you&#x27;re both.

&quot;What situation!?&quot; You get to your feet, making an equally wide gesture, unaware of how much you mirror your father.

&quot;The one where your name ends up in a federal investigation!&quot; he&#x27;s roaring now, looming over you.

[[What the Hell are you thinking?!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="74" name="Back off" tags="" position="717,1643">You think of the flask in your purse, shaped like a bangle bracelet.

You think of the cigarette case with a tiny, rolled piece of wax paper filled with white powder.

You think of the notes in the drawer of your desk in your room, the ones with drops of perfume and the lipstick prints on them.

You decide it&#x27;s best for you to shut up now before he catches on to all the many, many things you&#x27;ve been up to.

&quot;Fine,&quot; you say, tone made of ice. &quot;You got me!&quot; You hold up your hands in [[a mock surrender]]. &quot;I&#x27;ll go to my room and stay there. Happy?&quot;

You highly doubt that. He&#x27;s never followed through on making you clean up after anything in your life.

You unbuckle your heels.

You have never in your life stood up to him like this. You&#x27;ve had your fights, but this level of backtalk was never necessary... it really isn&#x27;t so necessary right now, but something about your weekend out of town has lit a fire under you.

You&#x27;re //angry// and you&#x27;re not even fully clear on what&#x27;s got you so worked up.

&quot;You sit here in your nice townhouse, or you go upstate with mother to the lake house, or you go into work and you&#x27;re surrounded by //this//, all of this! Why?

&quot;Don&#x27;t,&quot; he says, voice low and soft and scary. &quot;Not another word.&quot; He glares down at you. On reflex you draw back, and he raises a hand to point at you.

&quot;You will go to your room. You will think about //who you are// and //what is expected// and you will think of all the things I have given to you. And tomorrow you will stay in your room until you can shut your mouth and have dinner with //your family//. Since you seem to have forgotten exactly who that is.&quot;

As you brush out your hair, you question what you were thinking, berating yourself until the repetative action of brushing makes your brain go numb.

Your hair is much longer than it looks in the styles you wear, the fake bobs and chignons. The length is just a reminder to you: you&#x27;re not brave enough to cut it all off. You&#x27;re not brave enough to give up your respectability.

You&#x27;re caught between two things, and you don&#x27;t feel like you really belong to either one.

One hundred strokes. One hundred things to think about.

&quot;Stay away from that family,&quot; he says, half stern, half... concerned? You&#x27;re struggling for a moment to place your finger on his tone before he elaborates. &quot;You&#x27;re such an angel, Margaret. I&#x27;d hate to see you get caught up in a mess you don&#x27;t understand.&quot;

The idea of Mrs. Peabody at this type of social gathering is, frankly, hysterial, but you keep your giggles to yourself.

You shrug, just a helpless little lady in a great, big world. &quot;I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to get so held up!&quot; You shake your head slowly. &quot;They just don&#x27;t make them run like they did in Grandfather and Uncle Andrew&#x27;s day.&quot;

You look so innocent. So earnest. It&#x27;s easy to do.

&quot;If you&#x27;d rather I found another escort, I will. Father always knows best.&quot;

He opens his mouth, but you&#x27;re too quick for him. &quot;Thank you so very much for waiting up for me, daddy. It makes me feel so very watched over to have  such an aura of protection about the home!&quot;

You yawn and stretch. [[Your brother]] would never be able to get away with this if he were in as much trouble. You can be grateful of that much from your sex, you suppose.

&quot;You&#x27;re a //Carnegie//. And //this// family is not going to fall into ruin because of //your// actions.&quot;

He means this well, you think, but you feel your guts twisting.

All of her boarding school friends are engaged or married already. But she won&#x27;t stop pitching a fit about it.

What&#x27;s gotten into your baby girl?//

[[But you don&#x27;t know that.-&gt;You don&#x27;t know what to say.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="108" name="He&#x27;s getting loud." tags="" position="1470,639">&quot;I&#x27;m not a lair!&quot; you shout back, standing up. &quot;Stop calling me a liar!&quot;

He doesn&#x27;t respond, but he seizes you by the upper arm. You [[yelp]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="109" name="yelp" tags="" position="1347,741">He isn&#x27;t being rough. He&#x27;s never laid a hand on you in violence. But he is clearly angry.

You try to dig in your heels, but it does no good. He&#x27;s bigger and stronger than you, and you feel instantly guilty about pushing back too hard.

[[He takes you from the room and marches you up the stairs, to your room]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="110" name="He takes you from the room and marches you up the stairs, to your room" tags="" position="1315,851">He all but flings you inside. You stumble, but keep your feet under you.

The hallway light spills through the open doorway, a rectangular patch bathing you in a diffused yellow glow.

Your father stands in the doorway, framed in silhouette like a cameo, one hand on the doorknob.

[[You must have woken the whole house by now.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="111" name="You must have woken the whole house by now." tags="" position="1205,967">&quot;You will stay in here, and you will think about your lying, and your carousing, and your necking, and all this other inappropriate behavour!&quot;

He slams the door in your face, and the room is pitch black as your eyes adjust to the heavily curtained windows.

You hear a tell tale click of a key in the lock.

[[Slam against the door]]
[[Resign yourself]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="112" name="Slam against the door" tags="" position="1275,1073">Enraged, you throw your whole body agaisnt the door with great force. It rattles, but doesn&#x27;t budge.

Your father surely heard it, but you can&#x27;t hear him react.

You&#x27;re reminded how little ability you have to affect anything.

It&#x27;s all just silly strum and drang [[before accepting the inevitable-&gt;Resign yourself]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="113" name="Resign yourself" tags="" position="1399,953">You ready yourself for bed in silence, eyes adjusted to the half light from the windows enough that you don&#x27;t bother to turn on your bed lamp.

He didn&#x27;t believe you.

You told him the truth.

You curl onto your side in your bed, covers up over your head.

//You told him the truth.//

And either he didn&#x27;t believe you... or the truth was so horrible to him that he made it clear how much you needed to lie.

You stay awake thinking about that for a long, long time before a silent, dreamless sleep [[finally finds you-&gt;This time]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="114" name="START" tags="TITLE" position="22,6">{
